This project was Created During SoDAHACKS 2024 by Team The SafeNet Squad!

It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project built on React and TailwindCSS.

Project Title: The BiasGuard by the SafeNet Squad!
TRACK: Addressing Social Bias and develop Solutions to mitigate developing solutions that identifies, mitigates, and ultimately reduces harmful inherent biases in datasets (race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, wealth, income, etc.) promoting fairness and equity in vital resource for researchers, organizations, and individuals committed to social justice and equitable practices. 

Project Description:

In today’s data-driven world, the prevalence of inherent biases within datasets poses significant challenges to fairness, equity, and inclusivity. Our project, The BiasGuard, aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive web-based solution for users to analyze their datasets for potential social biases related to race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, wealth, and income.

This interactive web application empowers users to upload CSV files containing their datasets. Through an intuitive interface, users can effortlessly submit their data for analysis. The core functionality of our tool leverages a custom-trained Large Language Model (LLM) integrated into the backend. This model is designed to identify elements indicative of social bias and provide actionable insights to mitigate these biases effectively.

Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface: The website features a clean and modern design, with the project title prominently displayed at the top center. The layout is intuitive, ensuring ease of navigation for all users.

CSV File Upload: A straightforward upload element allows users to submit their CSV files directly. This feature supports various data formats, ensuring broad accessibility for users from different sectors.

Data Visualization Dashboard: Upon uploading a dataset, users are presented with an interactive dashboard that displays the uploaded data in a table format. This allows users to preview their data before processing.

Bias Detection and Analysis: After the initial data review, users can trigger the analysis process. The backend LLM identifies potential biases within the dataset and generates a detailed report outlining these biases.

Mitigation Suggestions: In addition to identifying biases, the tool offers tailored suggestions for mitigating and eliminating social biases in the dataset. These recommendations are presented alongside the analysis, empowering users to take informed actions.

Output Visualization: The results of the analysis, including the mitigated dataset, are displayed on the webpage in various formats, including data tables, charts, and graphs. This visual representation aids users in understanding the impact of biases and the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies.

Navigation Bar: A responsive navigation bar enhances user experience, providing easy access to essential sections of the website, including:

About: Learn more about the project and its objectives.
Team: Meet the developers and contributors behind the tool.
GitHub: Access the project’s codebase and contribute to its development.
Contact: Reach out for inquiries, feedback, or support.
Conclusion:
The BiasGuard Tool stands at the forefront of promoting fairness and equity in data analysis. By providing users with the ability to identify and address biases in their datasets, our project aims to foster a culture of inclusivity and accountability in data usage. Through continuous improvement and community engagement, we aspire to enhance the effectiveness of our tool, ensuring it remains a vital resource for researchers, organizations, and individuals committed to social justice and equitable practices.



## Getting Started
